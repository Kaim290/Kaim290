    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>
      Hey, I’m Kai. I’m a 22-year-old game developer and environment artist with a background in Computer Science. 
      I love creating immersive worlds, building systems from scratch, and bringing ideas to life inside Unreal Engine.
       Ever since I was little, my brother and I have been making video games together. We started in Unity
      and eventually moved to Unreal Engine. I'm an artist at heart, and I love
      taking the ideas in my head and turning them into something real—that's what
      keeps me passionate about game development.
    </p>

    <p>
      My projects range from replicated multiplayer dungeon crawlers to
      narrative-driven solo horror experiences. I create all of my assets and
      environments from scratch, giving each project its own visual identity.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm always looking to grow, learn more, refine my skills, and create better,
      higher-quality projects.

  <video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
    <source src="UnhallowedBosses.mp4">
  </video>
  <p> This clip showcases two of the project’s major boss encounters.
• The Gravemound — A hulking creature built from tombstones, bones, and graveyard debris. My brother created the base model, while I handled weight-painting, animation integration, and AI behavior.
• The Reaper — A skeletal warlock who uses ranged magic, AOE abilities, and teleport attacks. I created and simulated his cloak in Blender, handled the weight-painting, integrated both Mixamo and custom animations, and developed the behavior system. </p>

    <source src="UnhallowedBossRetargeting.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
    <p class="middle-text">
      Here are some animation retargets for the boss, the reaper. Once characters are rigged and weight painted we retarget them mostly using
      animations from Mixamo. </p>
  </div>
  <br>

    <h2> Phyics Handle </h2>
    <img src="UnhallowedPhysicsHandle.gif">
    <p> I implemented a physics-based interaction system allowing the player to pick up, move, and throw various objects—crates, furniture, and environmental props. One early limitation was that players could stand on objects they were holding, enabling unintended movement exploits.
    </p>

<h2> Map Showcase </h2>
  <video width="1080" height="720" autoplay loop muted playsinline>
    <source src="UnhallowedMapShowcase.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
he project features two distinct environments:
• A procedurally generated dungeon, built using a tile-based system and atmospheric lighting.
• A handcrafted lush forest area, created entirely from custom Blender assets and Unreal’s foliage tools.
Both regions were designed to contrast visually and give the world a sense of depth and variety.

  <h2>Multiplayer</h2>
  <h3>Lobbies</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <img src="HalloweenieLobby.gif" class="side-img">
      <p class="middle-text">
        A lobby system where players can create servers and join them</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <h3>Spawning System</h3>
  <img src="HalloweenieSpawnPlayers.gif" class="side-img" style="width: 100%" height="auto">
  <p> Once all players join the server, or all players are dead the server respawns the players</p>
  <br>

  <h3>Multiplayer Gameplay</h3>
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="HalloweenieMultiplayer.mp4">
  </video>
  <p>Once all players join a session, they can freely explore the world together. Player animations, item interactions, and enemy AI all replicate seamlessly across the server, creating a smooth and synchronized multiplayer experience. 
  </p>
  <h2>Maps</h2>
  <br>
  <video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
    <source src="HalloweenieRandomMap.mp4">
  </video>
  <strong>Forest</strong> <br>The forest uses an expanded version of the tile-based generation system from Unhallowed. Instead of placing individual tiles, the algorithm assembles full level chunks, allowing for larger, more natural outdoor environments with greater variation each run.. </p>
<br>
  <video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="HalloweenieBuiltMap.mp4">
  </video>
      <strong>Town</strong> <br> The town is a fully handcrafted environment featuring a fort, central settlement, train-station-style hub, and entry point to an underground mine system. All major structures and props were built and arranged manually. </p>
    <br>
      <video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="HalloweenieMines.mp4">
  </video>
      <strong>Mines</strong> <br>The mines extend from the edge of town into a dark, branching tunnel network. Players search for dynamite to clear blocked passages while an unseen threat stalks them from the shadows, heightening the tension as they progress. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Skin Customization</h2>
    <div class="row">
    <img src="HalloweenieSkinCustomization.gif" style="width: 75%">
          <p class="middle-text">
      <br> A fully replicated customization system allows players to personalize their character’s appearance with different skins and cosmetic variations, all synchronized across the network for other players to see. </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
          <p class="middle-text">
       <strong> Chaos Physics! </strong> <br> This demo showcases Unreal Engine’s Chaos physics system. Objects fracture into smaller simulated pieces, creating dynamic destruction effects that can be used for clearing blocked pathways or adding environmental interaction. </p>
    <img src="HalloweenieChaosPhysics.gif" width="540" height="auto">

          <p class="middle-text">
       <strong> Barriers </strong> <br> A barrier system. You can place materials, and once they're placed enemeies can destroy them.
      Once they're destroyed you can rebuild them without having to reexpend the materials. </p>
